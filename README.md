# Image-Based Entity Extraction  

## Overview  
This repository contains a machine learning solution for extracting key entity values (e.g., weight, dimensions) from product images. This project is designed for applications like e-commerce and healthcare, where detailed and accurate product descriptions are critical.  

---

## Features  
- **Image Processing:** Download product images from URLs and preprocess them for analysis.  
- **Entity Prediction:** Use machine learning to predict numerical values with corresponding units.  
- **Output Formatting:** Ensure predictions adhere to predefined formats and constraints.  
- **Validation:** A sanity checker validates the output before submission.  
- **Evaluation Metric:** Uses the F1 score to assess model performance.  

---

## Installation  

1. **Clone the Repository:**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/entity-extraction.git  
   cd entity-extraction  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies:**  
   Install the required Python libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

---

## File Structure  

- **Source Code:**  
  - `src/utils.py`: Download and preprocess images.  
  - `src/constants.py`: Define allowed units for predictions.  
  - `src/sanity.py`: Validate the output file formatting.  

- **Dataset Files:**  
  - `dataset/train.csv`: Training dataset with labeled values.  
  - `dataset/test.csv`: Test dataset for generating predictions.  
  - `dataset/sample_test_out.csv`: Example output format.  

---

## Usage  

1. **Download Images:**  
   Use the helper function in `src/utils.py` to download images. Example:  
   ```python  
   from src.utils import download_images  
   download_images(image_link_column, save_path)  
   ```  

2. **Train the Model:**  
   Train your machine learning model using `dataset/train.csv`.  

3. **Generate Predictions:**  
   Use your model to predict entity values for `dataset/test.csv`.  

4. **Format Output:**  
   Save predictions in the required format (`test_out.csv`) and validate using:  
   ```bash  
   python src/sanity.py --file test_out.csv  
   ```  

5. **Submit Results:**  
   Upload the validated `test_out.csv` file to the portal for evaluation.  

---

## Output Format  

Ensure the output CSV contains:  
- **index:** Unique identifier matching the test file.  
- **prediction:** Values in the format “x unit” (e.g., "12 gram").  

Example:  
| index | prediction       |  
|-------|------------------|  
| 1     | 34 gram          |  
| 2     | 12.5 centimetre  |  

---

## Constraints  

- Allowed units are defined in `src/constants.py`.  
- Ensure all predictions match the required format using the sanity checker.  

---

## Evaluation  

The model is evaluated using the F1 score, balancing precision and recall for accurate predictions.
