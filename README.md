Image-Based Entity Extraction
Overview
This project develops a machine learning model to extract entity values (e.g., weight, dimensions) from product images. The extracted data aids in generating accurate descriptions for digital marketplaces, crucial for enhancing user experiences in fields like e-commerce and healthcare.

Features
Data Handling: Downloads and processes images from provided URLs.
Entity Prediction: Predicts numerical and unit values (e.g., "34 gram").
Output Formatting: Ensures predictions match required formats for validation.
Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy evaluated using the F1 score.
File Structure
Source Files:

src/utils.py: Download images.
src/constants.py: Defines allowed units.
src/sanity.py: Checks output formatting.
Dataset Files:

dataset/train.csv: Training data with labels.
dataset/test.csv: Test data without labels.
Installation
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/entity-extraction.git  
cd entity-extraction  
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Usage
Train the Model:
Train a model using dataset/train.csv.

Generate Predictions:
Predict entity values for images in dataset/test.csv.

Format Output:
Ensure predictions are formatted as specified using src/sanity.py.

Submit Results:
Upload the test_out.csv file for evaluation.

Constraints
Predictions must follow specific units and formats defined in constants.py.
Use the sanity checker to validate output formatting.
Evaluation
Accuracy is measured using the F1 score, balancing precision and recall.
